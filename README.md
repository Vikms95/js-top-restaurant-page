Restaurant Project using webpack and modules.

What I learnt with this project: 
- Webpack basic settings and tools to make development easier and more realiable. Basic setup of the project with npx init, dumping of data with npx webpack as well as QOL commands such as npx webpack watch to update the contents on page load automatically, without having to enter npx webpack everytime.

- Modularize functions that create and delete diferent parts of the DOM

- Using gitignore to avoid updating irrelevant dependencies 

- Creating event listeners that would remove parts of the DOM and trigger a function to add new content
